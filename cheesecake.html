<h4>Ingredients</h4>

    <li>Sour cream</li>

<h1>Steps</h1>
<h5>Make the Crust</h5>
<ol>
    <li>Finely chop your pecans using either a knife, food processor, or crush them by whacking with the back of a spoon. Place in a bowl</li>
    <li>Add the graham cracker crumbs and sugar and stir to combine.</li>
    <li>Pour in the butter and mix until everything is moistened.</li>
    <li>Press into a springform pan, making sure to go high up the sides of the pan. Set this aside–no need to pre-bake!</li>
</ol>

<h5>Make the Cheesecake</h5>
<ol>
    <li>Beat the cream cheese and sugar on medium speed until smooth and creamy. There should be no lumps in this mixture!</li>
    <li>Add the sour cream and vanilla and stir on low speed until everything is smooth</li>
    <li>Lightly beat one egg with a fork, then stir into the batter. Repeat with the remaining eggs, working one at a time until each egg is just combined.</li>
    <li>Pour half the batter into your prepared crust, then drizzle ¼ cup of caramel sauce overtop.</li>
    <li>Add the remaining cheesecake batter and smooth the surface. Bake at 325F for 50-55 minutes or until almost set; the center will be jiggly but the edges should be set and may have puffed slightly.</li>
    <li>Let the cheesecake sit in the oven with the door open just a few inches for 1 hour. Remove and let cool to room temperature before placing in the fridge to chill for at least 6 hours.</li>
    <li>Add the remaining caramel sauce on top. I like to pop my cheesecake back in the fridge to let the caramel solidify a bit before slicing–it just yields prettier slices this way!</li>
    <li>Sprinkle with flaky salt, then slice and serve.</li>
